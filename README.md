# LoRa_Relay_Repeater

Description:
In large areas or places with many obstacles, the transmission between devices has a lot of trouble. So, to increase the distance and stability, we developed an intermediate device to repeat the packets.

Suppose the first device is the transmitter, the second is the repeater, and the third is the receiver. After the repeater receives a packet from the transmitter, it retransmits this packet to the receiver.
Transmiter ---------> Repeater Â ---------> Receiver

This demo project simulates the transmission between two devices:
